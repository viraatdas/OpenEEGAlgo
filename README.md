# OpenEEGAlgo
This project is intended to further the development of models used in future implementations of Brain-Computer
Interfaces.

Data contained within the repository was acquired experimetanlly in a lab at West Virginia University using the OpenBCI
Cyton headset. 

As of now, the data can be divided into three subsets: endogenous stimuli (or without an external stimuli), exogenous
ones using auditory and visual stimuli. 

The names of the people displayed in the repository aren't real * but appropriately are associated with that person's
data.
